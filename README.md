⚔️ Top-Down Arena Survivor | Unity 6 & C#

📌 Project Overview
This project is an arena-survivor game developed with Unity 6, focusing on scalability, performance, and robust software engineering principles. Rather than just a gameplay demo, this repository serves as a showcase of clean code, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and sustainable architecture meant for long-term product development.

🎯 Engineering Highlights
State-Machine Based AI: Designed and implemented enemy AI using a modular state-machine pattern to ensure behaviors are easily expandable and maintainable.
Scalable Wave Spawning: Engineered a flexible wave system capable of handling increasing difficulty curves.
Physics-Driven Combat: Developed custom knockback-based physics and precise hit-detection systems to maximize "game feel" while maintaining code clarity.
Modular Skill & Power-Up Systems: Built a timed active skill and power-up architecture that allows for rapid iteration of new gameplay mechanics.

🛠 Technical Stack & CS Fundamentals
Engine: Unity 6 (LTS).
Language: C# utilizing Advanced OOP and Design Patterns.
Version Control: Professional Git/GitHub workflow, including descriptive commits and documentation.
Engineering Core: Deep reliance on Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Architecture principles.
