⚔️ Top-Down Arena Survivor | Unity 6 & C#

📌 Project Overview
The project currently features multiple enemy types, wave-based progression, and active skill mechanics, and is under active development. Focusing on scalability, performance, and robust software engineering principles. Rather than just a gameplay demo, this repository serves as a showcase of clean code, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and sustainable architecture meant for long-term product development.

🎯 Engineering Highlights
- State-Machine Based AI: Designed and implemented modular enemy AI using a state-machine pattern for extensibility and maintainability.
- Scalable Wave Spawning: Engineered a flexible wave system supporting increasing difficulty curves.
- Physics-Driven Combat: Developed custom knockback-based physics and precise hit-detection to improve game feel.
- Modular Skill & Power-Up Systems: Built a timed active skill and power-up architecture allowing rapid iteration of new mechanics.


🛠 Technical Stack & CS Fundamentals
Engine: Unity 6 (LTS).
Language: C# utilizing Advanced OOP and Design Patterns.
Version Control: Professional Git/GitHub workflow, including descriptive commits and documentation.
Engineering Core: Deep reliance on Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Architecture principles.

🧠 Why This Project?
This project was built to strengthen my understanding of gameplay programming, AI architecture, and scalable system design in Unity. 
It reflects my focus on writing maintainable, extensible code rather than one-off gameplay prototypes.
